1. Must be able to keep track of when a card is clicked on...use variables


User can flip over a card

If the user clicks on another card and it matches, they stay

If the user clicks on another card and it does not match they both flip back over

The game is over when the user has matched all the cards

Each selected card should be assigned to a variable (at least). A user should only be able to select two cards at a time. If the cards do not match, each card will de-selected. And then the user should select two more cards.

Next steps = What does the event listener actually do? Hold on to one card, while clicking on another.
